## Installation

```
$ npm install @sap-ai-sdk/document-grounding
```

## Prerequisites

- [Enable the AI Core service in SAP BTP](https://help.sap.com/docs/sap-ai-core/sap-ai-core-service-guide/initial-setup).
- Configure the project with **Node.js v20 or higher** and **native ESM** support.
- Ensure an orchestration deployment is available in the SAP Generative AI Hub.
  - Use the [`DeploymentApi`](https://github.com/SAP/ai-sdk-js/blob/main/packages/ai-api/README.md#create-a-deployment) from `@sap-ai-sdk/ai-api` [to create a deployment](https://help.sap.com/docs/sap-ai-core/sap-ai-core-service-guide/create-deployment-for-orchestration).
    Alternatively, you can also create deployments using the [SAP AI Launchpad](https://help.sap.com/docs/sap-ai-core/generative-ai-hub/activate-generative-ai-hub-for-sap-ai-launchpad?locale=en-US&q=launchpad).
  - Once the deployment is complete, access the orchestration service via the `deploymentUrl`.

> **Accessing the AI Core Service via the SDK**
>
> The SDK automatically retrieves the `AI Core` service credentials and resolves the access token needed for authentication.
>
> - In Cloud Foundry, it's accessed from the `VCAP_SERVICES` environment variable.
> - In Kubernetes / Kyma environments, you have to mount the service binding as a secret instead, for more information refer to [this documentation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sap/xsenv#usage-in-kubernetes).
